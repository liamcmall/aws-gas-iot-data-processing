# IoT Gas Sensor Data Processing #

This project demonstrates a cloud-based system for processing sensor data using AWS services. The data originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository's gas sensor dataset, simulating real-time data ingestion from gas sensors used for home activity monitoring.

## Technologies Used:
- AWS IoT Core: Collects and simulates real-time sensor data ingestion.
- AWS Lambda: Processes and forwards incoming data.
- Amazon RDS: Stores and manages the processed sensor data in a SQL database.
- AWS SageMaker: Builds and deploys machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- SQL: Analyzes sensor data stored in the cloud database.
